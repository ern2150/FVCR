Ninja Strike Force (heretoafter NSF) is an exercise in duplicity. Being comprised of (at least) two separate "movies", as many Godfrey Ho productions [citation needed] are, this should be unsurprising.  But in fact, I'm about to tell you something that'll stun you rigid -- the NSF is a front for the CIA!

That's right, none other than the Carwash Injustice Agency is behind this whole film.  Street urchins in high traffic cities often try to make money washing stopped cars' windshields [citation needed].  This service is rarely appreciated, and even though the quality of the wash is never perfect, it usually leads to some kind of abuse.
The protagonists of this film are car wash workers themselves, and suffer no end of abuse for a single original sin.
This sin was out of the control of the lead of this film - Mickey Mouse - to whom fate dealt a hand of cards.
As I'll explain, this hand came from a stacked deck!

Mickey Mouse's deck is fed from four main sources.
First, he's an orphan.
Second, perhaps because of the poverty and therefore poor healthcare associated with the lack of a familial support structure, Mickey has a chronic illness that causes him to cough uncontrollably at times.
Third, Mickey is saved / supported by Jim Jones, who himself is connected by fate to a larger problem which distracts him from Mickey's care at a crucial point.
Fourth, a crime boss sets up Mickey to take the fall during a literal game of cards!

The crime boss' birthday party is where Mickey is set up to fail.  The boss, out of generosity, lends Mickey some money, since he's "down on his luck."  Mickey bets this money on a card game but makes sure he doesn't lose it - he wants to be a good steward of the gift he's been given.  He does this by hiding a card in his shoe that later wins him a hand.  His deceit is quickly discovered, and is chased by the boss' thugs to the part of the complex where Jim and his kid brother live.
