[FVCR's tweet about the first Context Club (archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20200908170839/https://twitter.com/forgottenvcr/status/1303379378408247297) 

Ninja Strike Force (heretoafter NSF) is an exercise in duplicity. Being comprised of (at least) two separate "movies", as many Godfrey Ho productions<sup>[1](#1)</sup> are, this should be unsurprising.  But in fact, I'm about to tell you something that'll stun you rigid -- the NSF is a front for the CIA!

That's right, none other than the Carwash Injustice Agency is behind this whole film.  Street urchins in high traffic cities often try to make money washing stopped cars' windshields<sup>[1](#1)</sup>.  This service is rarely appreciated, and even though the quality of the wash is never perfect, it usually leads to some kind of abuse.
The protagonists of this film are car wash workers themselves, and suffer no end of abuse for a single original sin.
This sin was out of the control of the lead of this film - Mickey Mouse - to whom fate dealt a hand of cards.
As I'll explain, this hand came from a stacked deck!

Mickey Mouse's deck is fed from four main sources.
First, he's an orphan.
Second, perhaps because of the lack of a familial support structure, Mickey suffers from a chronic illness that causes him to cough uncontrollably at times.
Third, once Mickey is supported by someone, they're distracted from his care at a crucial point.
Fourth, a crime boss sets up Mickey to take the fall during a literal game of cards!

The crime boss' birthday party is where Mickey is set up to fail.  The boss, out of generosity, lends Mickey some money, since he's "down on his luck."  Mickey bets this money on a card game but makes sure he doesn't lose it - he wants to be a good steward of the gift he's been given.  He does this by hiding a card in his shoe that later wins him a hand.  His deceit is quickly discovered, and is chased by the boss' thugs to the part of the complex where someone named Jim and his kid brother live.

Jim Jones was introduced to us in a photograph as the heir to a Ninja Master. That Master's colleagues are in peril and seeking his son for any advice or powers he may have inherited. Jim, however, is "down on his luck" himself, as he's fired from several jobs for not wanting to compromise his morals to soothe fragile egos. After leaving one such job, he spies Mickey near his home making tea near someone washing a car. Moments later, he runs into Mickey escaping thugs in the basement, but refuses to give up his location despite their abuse.

Mickey soon joins Jim's new business of washing cars, observed from afar by the Ninja Master's colleague's pupil<sup>[3](#3)</sup> Gordon.
All is not perfect, however, as a rival carwash gang calls the authorities in to shut them down for lack of license.
Bubbles and Zoos only temporarily ease the stress of responsibility as the two worlds finally collide -- Gordon meets Jim.

He pleads with Jim to help, who rebuffs him.
The placement of their faces in the scene seems normal, but might not in real life:  
Gordon left, looking right.  
Jimmy right (?), looking left (?).  
This is a standard trick to make it easy to separate characters when cutting back and forth.
If two characters are talking and one's on the left and the other's on the right, it looks better / simpler.


Trouble soon follows as the crime boss comes to collect, and even though their new business is doing alright, it's not enough to prevent more abuse.
During this fight, Mickey is hurt bad enough to bleed from his mouth, foreshadowing later internal injuries.
Despite attempts by Jim to earn money to buy medicine, Mickey remains stubborn about his condition being beyond help.

Gordon calls once again, only this time, simplicity breaks down.  
Gordon bottom left, looks top right.
Jim top center, looks bottom left.  
Same as before.

Gordon stands up top center, facing rear right.
Gordon turns clockwise, faces front, looks bottom center to talk to Jim.  
What?  Did Gordon turn right before standing up for no reason?

Jim top off-frame left, looks center.
Gordon top left, facing rear left.
Gordon turns counter-clockwise, faces front, looks left to talk to Jim.
Double What?! Gordon, stand still, you'll break reality!

Gordon exits right.
Jim top left, facing right, turns clockwise, faces front.  
I don't even know anymore.  
They not only broke 180<sup>[4](#4)</sup>, they broke 720!

Jim, distracted by this, girlfriends, and bicycle races, fails to see Mickey overextending himself.
Mickey is working hard to save up for a present for Jim.  
Mickey's health is so poor that carrying home this present, on a bicycle, causes him to cough blood and then collapse.

Jim is so busy writing his unhelpful message to Gordon and accusing people of buying him stereos to notice this.
Instead Mickey's old friend the balloon man has to tell him, and beats him to the hospital by multiple hours.
Jim then has the gall to call Mickey f****ng stupid?!
You're the stupid one, Jim!

Mickey shuffles off this mortal coil, sending one more message via balloon-man's help to his parents / heaven with a map to guide him there.
For once, Jim helps, and writes the directions.
At least it wasn't Gordon doing so, or Mickey might end up all turned around.

In conclusion, aren't we all like Mickey sometimes?
The CIA wants us to think so, and sympathize-- nay, empathize with him.
So if you see a guy washing windshields sometime, and he wants to do yours, think a little.

What would Mickey Mouse do?
