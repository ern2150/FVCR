Ninja Strike Force (heretoafter NSF) is an exercise in duality. Being comprised of (at least) two separate "movies", as many Godfrey Ho productions [citation needed] are, this should be unsurprising.  But in fact, I'm about to tell you something that'll stun you rigid -- the NSF is a front for the CIA!

That's right, none other than the Carwash Injustice Agency is behind this whole film.  Street urchins in high traffic cities often try to make money washing stopped cars' windshields [citation needed].  This service is rarely appreciated, and even though the quality of the wash is never perfect, it usually leads to some kind of abuse.
