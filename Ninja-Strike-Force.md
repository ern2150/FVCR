Ninja Strike Force (heretoafter NSF) is an exercise in duplicity. Being comprised of (at least) two separate "movies", as many Godfrey Ho productions<sup>[0](#0)</sup> are, this should be unsurprising.  But in fact, I'm about to tell you something that'll stun you rigid -- the NSF is a front for the CIA!

That's right, none other than the Carwash Injustice Agency is behind this whole film.  Street urchins in high traffic cities often try to make money washing stopped cars' windshields<sup>[1](#1)</sup>.  This service is rarely appreciated, and even though the quality of the wash is never perfect, it usually leads to some kind of abuse.
The protagonists of this film are car wash workers themselves, and suffer no end of abuse for a single original sin.
This sin was out of the control of the lead of this film - Mickey Mouse - to whom fate dealt a hand of cards.
As I'll explain, this hand came from a stacked deck!

Mickey Mouse's deck is fed from four main sources.
First, he's an orphan.
Second, perhaps because of the lack of a familial support structure, Mickey suffers from a chronic illness that causes him to cough uncontrollably at times.
Third, once Mickey is supported by someone, they're distracted from his care at a crucial point.
Fourth, a crime boss sets up Mickey to take the fall during a literal game of cards!

The crime boss' birthday party is where Mickey is set up to fail.  The boss, out of generosity, lends Mickey some money, since he's "down on his luck."  Mickey bets this money on a card game but makes sure he doesn't lose it - he wants to be a good steward of the gift he's been given.  He does this by hiding a card in his shoe that later wins him a hand.  His deceit is quickly discovered, and is chased by the boss' thugs to the part of the complex where someone named Jim and his kid brother live.

Jim Jones was introduced to us in a photograph as the heir to a Ninja Master. That Master's colleagues are in peril and seeking his son for any advice or powers he may have inherited. Jim, however, is "down on his luck" himself, as he's fired from several jobs for not wanting to compromise his morals to soothe fragile egos. After leaving one such job, he spies Mickey near his home making tea near someone washing a car. Moments later, he runs into Mickey escaping thugs in the basement, but refuses to give up his location despite their abuse.

Mickey soon joins Jim's new business of washing cars, observed from afar by the Ninja Master's colleague's pupil<sup>[2](#2)</sup> Gordon.
All is not perfect, however, as a rival carwash gang calls the authorities in to shut them down for lack of license.
Bubbles and Zoos only temporarily ease the stress of responsibility as the two worlds finally meet and Gordon pleads with Jim to help, who rebuffs him.
Trouble soon follows as the crime boss comes to collect, and even though their new business is doing alright, it's not enough to prevent more abuse.
During this fight, Mickey is hurt bad enough to bleed from his mouth, foreshadowing later internal injuries.
Despite attempts by Jim to earn money to buy medicine, Mickey remains stubborn about his condition being beyond help.

Gordon calls once again.
