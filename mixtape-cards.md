What is this?
--------
There's more than one way to pick which Mixtapes to run for a particular broadcast, and this is just one weird idea.  
There are enough Mixtapes for now to map to most of a 52+ card deck.  
If you shuffle a deck, and deal out four or five cards, chances are most of them would map to a Mixtape using the tables below.  

Why deal out multiple cards, why not just the top one?
--------
You could totally pick off the top of the deck until you find something suitable if you're just looking to pick one Mixtape.  
If you pick multiple, you can then use them to create a poll or vote.  
And who knows?  Maybe multiple people could do this and play a standard card game to whittle down the list.

Spades (11-20)
--------
* Ace = 11 = I'm a Winner
* 2 = 12 = Defend Yourself
* ...
* 10 = 20 = Cheap Thug in a Dirty Racket

Clubs (21-30)
--------
* Ace = 21 = Enlightenment Isn't Serious
* ...
* 10 = 30 = Don't Be a Big Shot

Diamonds (31-40)
--------
* Ace = 31 = Magic Hand
* ...
* 10 = 40 = Is There No End of It?

Herts (41-49)
--------
* Ace = 41 = You Bastards Are from the 30th Century?!
* ...
* 9 = 49 = Despise the Dark

Early Tapes (6-9)
--------
* Jack of Spades = 6 = I Don't Like Love, 'Cause I Love You
* Jack of Clubs = 7 = Damn You, Blue Mask
* Jack of Diamonds = 8 = You're Not a Ninja, You Can't Use the Beans
* Jack of Herts = 9 = I Know What It Takes to Be Invincible

Non-Numbered (Video Beam, Forced Stereo, etc)
--------
* Queen of Spades = Video Beam Volume One
* Queen of Clubs = Forced Stereo Deluxe

And Don't Forget
--------
* The Joker = ?? To Be Determined once Rules are written
* Cards that don't map to a Mixtape yet = ?? To Be Determined once Rules are written
