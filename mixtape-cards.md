What is this?
--------
There's more than one way to pick which Mixtapes to run for a particular broadcast, and this is just one weird idea.  
There are enough Mixtapes for now to map to most of a 52+ card deck.  
If you shuffle a deck, and deal out four or five cards, chances are most of them would map to a Mixtape using the tables below.  

Why deal out multiple cards, why not just the top one?
--------
You could totally pick off the top of the deck until you find something suitable if you're just looking to pick one Mixtape.  
If you pick multiple, you can then use them to create a poll or vote.  
And who knows?  Maybe multiple people could do this and play a standard card game to whittle down the list.

Mappings (rules are after the tables)
--------
The mappings below are changeable.  This was just the first crack at keeping things simple.  
If, for example, I didn't do my research and The Young Ones Lemmy clip isn't in Mixtape 11 or any Mixtape starting with 1, we can adjust ;)  
Same deal with a particular suit and its spelling and which run of Mixtapes apply better to that.

Spades (11-20)
--------
* Ace = 11 = I'm a Winner
* 2 = 12 = Defend Yourself
* ...
* 10 = 20 = Cheap Thug in a Dirty Racket

Clubs (21-30)
--------
* Ace = 21 = Enlightenment Isn't Serious
* ...
* 10 = 30 = Don't Be a Big Shot

Diamonds (31-40)
--------
* Ace = 31 = Magic Hand
* ...
* 10 = 40 = Is There No End of It?

Herts (41-50)
--------
* Ace = 41 = You Bastards Are from the 30th Century?!
* ...
* 9 = 49 = Despise the Dark
* 10 = 50 = The Awesome Power of Destruction You Possess

Early Tapes (6-9)
--------
* Jack of Spades = 6 = I Don't Like Love, 'Cause I Love You
* Jack of Clubs = 7 = Damn You, Blue Mask
* Jack of Diamonds = 8 = You're Not a Ninja, You Can't Use the Beans
* Jack of Herts = 9 = I Know What It Takes to Be Invincible

Non-Numbered (Video Beam, Forced Stereo, etc)
--------
* Queen of Spades = Video Beam (Volume One so far)
* Queen of Clubs = Forced Stereo (Deluxe so far)
* Queen of Diamonds = 10 = Everything at Once
* Queen of Herts = Avi's Media Powerpoint about Naoko

Recent Tapes (51-?)
--------
* King of Spades = 51 = Money, Power, and Position
* King of Clubs = 52 = Let You Through to Hell
* 3 of Spades (13 is retired) = 53 = The True Form of His Brains
* King of Diamonds = 54 = Sounds Like the Devil
* King of Herts = 55 = I Had a Heart Once
* 6 of Spades (16 is retired) = 56 = Everyone Has to Live, Even Thieves

And Don't Forget
--------
* The Joker = ?? feel free to suggest a Rule
* Cards that don't map to a valid Mixtape = flexible, but see Rules first

Rules / Questions
--------
* In general, if you deal a card that doesn't map to a valid(++) Mixtape, feel free to exclude it or deal another.
* (++)Valid Mixtapes can kinda mean whatever you want.  Either there's literally no mapping in the tables above, or the Mixtape is retired, or we just watched that one, etc.  Dealing multiple cards at once helps since it's more likely you'll have more than one valid card left over.  You could even move these invalid cards to a separate deck, and then shuffle them back in as they become valid (either it's been long enough or we've reassigned/mapped that card to a different Mixtape).  "Timely" Mixtapes that didn't get a number (like Halloween or end-of-year best-ofs) are probably considered invalid.
* It's also fine if the deck is re-shuffled each time we need it.  If you have a house where a deck of cards stays exactly the same week to week, you're more organized than I :)
* What if we run out of cards? Hooray!  More Mixtapes! There are some gaps in the 10s to make room, eventually, if needed, and there are two Jokers, and sometimes tapes get retired.  All else fails we can shift the whole scheme to be more flexible, where two cards get dealt, one to determine "decade" and another to determine position within that decade.  Takes away direct mapping, of course, but still fun.
